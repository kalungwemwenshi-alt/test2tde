        <h2>Why Personal Branding Matters</h2>
        <p>
            In the digital world, people don’t buy products first they buy people.
            Your personal brand is your biggest asset. It builds:
            Trust before you even speak.
            Influence that multiplies opportunities.
            Authority that lets you charge more.
            <br>

            The truth? You don’t need to be famous, you need to be credible and consistent. Start today: share your story, show your wins and lessons, and watch how doors open.
